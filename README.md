# Handling-Public-API
This app is built with JavaScript and Html.
This app is used to get New York weather information from provided public API and show it in UI based on current month weeks


Create a form with 1 dropdown “Select Week” which will list all the weeks of the current month and 1 button “Start Tracking” in the middle of the screen. Once the button is clicked, an API call will be sent to the weather API to get the weather details of 1 week for New York.
*API details are at the end of this problem description.

On successful API calls, a table will be shown on the web page with Temperature details where table will have the following columns:
●	Day
●	Date
●	Min Temperature
●	Max Temperature

If there’s an error in the API, a custom error message “An error Occurred” should be shown instead of the table.
